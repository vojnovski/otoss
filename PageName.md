## The OpenTravel Specification and Supporting Artifacts ##

The OpenTravel Specification is the core product of OpenTravel and consists of a large library of XML Schema files
The OpenTravel Code Table is a spreadsheet that is maintained consistently and contains a comprehensive list of all codes referenced within the XML Schema files.
Requests for new OpenTravel codes need to follow the procedures for requesting new OpenTravel codes.
The OpenTravel Forum website
Authoring content for the OpenTravel Message Users Guide which is included with the OpenTravel Specification download.
Solution Scenarios are designed to educate implementers on the functionality within the OpenTravel Specification by serving as a library for code samples, best practices, and technical white papers; showcasing solution examples that are generic examples that can be re-used, re-purposed or extended by developers; and showcasing schema components that provide common functionality and easy integration into corporate solutions, enabling the implementer to be more efficient and consistent in building those solutions.
The OpenTravel Implementation Guide is a must have and you can get your copy here. The purpose of this guide is to provide, in a single document, information that an implementer of the OpenTravel specification can use to more easily build software systems that are interoperable with other travel systems. The guide also should be useful for analysts who need to understand how to use the OpenTravel specification.
